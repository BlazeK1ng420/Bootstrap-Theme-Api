# Bootstrap-Theme-Api
  A simple, lightweight, and responsive, API-style Bootstrap 5 implementation for easily managing css themes dynamically, with minimal effort and input.

  Built for Bootstrap v5.3.2
That means full compatability with ALL of Bootstraps newest color based features, such as:

"data-bs-theme()"
"color-mode()"
"prefers-color-scheme()"
All of which are proudly on display somewhere on this page.

Okay, what's so special then you might ask?

Well great Question!

The thing is, while all these features have been officially added to the most recent Bootstrap 5 releases, theres still no official JavaScript or CSS methods included for actually USING the colorful code within it.

Okay, thats a lie, sorta..
There is this snippit in the Bootstraps docs for toggling between a light & dark mode. But thats it.. You get light or dark ONLY, with any additional "modes" requiring sass compilation, javascript editing, multiple changes to your html, ect.
Not to mention that on top of that, the way its offered currently, it doesnt natively offer the ability to Toggle any new "modes" between the original light and dark, so any custom color modes cannot be further tailored to the end-users preference of a light or dark version if they wanted to utilize a red or green accent mode you offer on your page.

This can be potentially off-putting to:

New users
Those coming from older versions
Anyone using only plug-n-play snippits
Lazy or the easily deterred lol
My goal with this template, is to enable ANYONE, regardless of their experience, the ability to utilize the many different color based aspects offered within Bootstrap all with a simpler streamlined process that I hope you enjoy using as much as I did learning how to make it all work and play nicely together haha.
